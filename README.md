# -gov.au-template
Use DTA @GOV.AU artefacts to create a useable template giving examples.

Steps to get running

1. clone the project
2. cd into the project folder
3. npm install
4. gulp copy <!-- This copies vendor content into the /app/vendor folder for use -->
5. gulp dev <!-- runs the project for dev mode! -->

Enjoy..

Is in very early stages so almost nothing there yet :)
